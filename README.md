# Z-Score_Outlier_Filter

A short MATLAB program that inputs and outputs Excel files.
The program filters out all values with a Z Score above the user specified value across the specified channels.
It is intended to treat every channel specified as one set of data. That is, Z Scores are calculated for the data present in one channel at a time.

This program was written for analytical processes in the Social Interaction and Performance Science Lab at the University of Central Lancashire.
